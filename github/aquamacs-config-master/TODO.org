# Navigation and Project Management #
- Bind some key as a navigation key, e.g. `C-N {nav}` so that we can
  have quick ways of reaching partiuclar projects or functions.
- For example, `nav=P` could give a list of all projects (active and
  inactive)
- `nav=V` could give options for version control, such as status
- access window configuration etc
- the navigation could be in a popup frame, or as an anything menu
